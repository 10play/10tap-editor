# Migrating to v1.0

This guide will help you migrate from pre-1.0 versions to v1.0 of 10tap-editor.

## Breaking Changes

### Custom Keyboard Removed

The custom keyboard functionality has been removed in v1.0. This includes:

- `CustomKeyboard` component
- `CustomKeyboardUtils` API
- Color keyboard example
- Custom keyboard example

### KeyboardAvoidingView Behavior Changed

The `behavior` prop for `KeyboardAvoidingView` has been simplified in v1.0.

**Before (Pre-1.0):**
```tsx
<KeyboardAvoidingView
  behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'height'}
  style={exampleStyles.keyboardAvoidingView}
>
  <Toolbar editor={editor} />
</KeyboardAvoidingView>
```

**After (v1.0):**
```tsx
<KeyboardAvoidingView
  behavior={'padding'}
  style={exampleStyles.keyboardAvoidingView}
>
  <Toolbar editor={editor} />
</KeyboardAvoidingView>
```

The platform-specific check is no longer needed - use `'padding'` for both iOS and Android.

### SafeAreaView Import Changed

`SafeAreaView` now uses `react-native-safe-area-context` instead of `react-native`.

**Before (Pre-1.0):**
```tsx
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';
```

**After (v1.0):**
```tsx
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
```

Make sure you have `react-native-safe-area-context` installed and configured properly.

## Updated Dependencies

v1.0 is based on Tiptap v3, which brings improved performance and new features.

Update your dependencies:
```bash
yarn add @10play/tentap-editor@latest react-native-webview@latest
```

For iOS, update pods:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```
