# Introduction

TenTap is a typed, easy to use, customizable, and extendable Rich Text editor for React-Native based on Tiptap and Prosemirror. It offers a "plug and play" experience and comes with many essential features out of the box that can be incorporated into your apps quickly. Additionally, TenTap allows you the developers to tailor the editor to your applications specific needs. TenTap is based on TipTap and Prosemirror which are well known and trusted open source RichText libraries.

## Why?

After years of developing rich text editors for mobile, we realized that there is an empty void for open source RichText editors on mobile especially for ReactNative. So we have decided to create this package that incorporates all that we have learned, and that provides the best possible ux. Tentap is designed for getting the best experience of editing rich-text on mobile inspired by state of the art mobile editors like: gdocs, notion, dropbox paper.

## Features:

- An easy and typed way to communicate with tiptap/prosemirror on the native side
- All the features/plugins tiptap/prosemirror has
- Custom keyboard
- Typescript
- A lot of small fixes to make sure exp is good for mobile like: (follow cursor)
